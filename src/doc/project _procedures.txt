1.oracle database create
   #after the first access to Oracle, set the password of 'SYS' into 1234.
    seemed the password was not 1234. you can login as SYS as follows. 
	you can skip the 'enter password' part.
	
	DB account info: id|sys    pw|1234 
					 id|system pw|1234 
					 id|im  pw|1234
	change user: alter user admin identified by 1234;	
    who is the user: show user;	
					 
	C:\Users\inufu>sqlplus
	Enter user-name: sys as sysdba
	Enter password:
	SQL> alter user sys identified by 1234;
	
	in oracle, 'system' cannot create DB, while 'SYS' can create DB.
	
	because SYS cannot drop a column of a table,
	I created a new DB account 'admin' through the steps below on Oracle DB.
  
  SQL> conn sys as sysdba
		Enter password:
		Connected.
 
  SQL> alter session set "_ORACLE_SCRIPT"=true;
	   Session altered.
 
  SQL> commit;
	   Commit complete.
 
  SQL> CREATE USER ARADMIN IDENTIFIED BY AR#Admin# DEFAULT TABLESPACE ARSYSTEM TEMPORARY TABLESPACE ARTMPSPC1 QUOTA UNLIMITED ON ARSYSTEM;
		User created.
 
  SQL> conn ARAdmin/AR#Admin#
		ERROR: ORA-01045: user ARADMIN lacks CREATE SESSION privilege; logon denied
 
  SQL> create role ARole_arsys not identified;
		Role created.
 
  SQL> grant alter session, create cluster, create database link, create sequence,
	2  create session, create synonym, create table, create view, create procedure,
	3  create trigger, query rewrite to ARole_arsys;
	   Grant succeeded.
 
  SQL> commit;
	    Commit complete.
 
  SQL> grant ARole_arsys to aradmin;
		Grant succeeded.
 
  SQL> commit;
		Commit complete.
 
2.create springboot project in eclipse
	execution: project left click -> run as -> springboot app
3.add JSP into the project	
    spring default doesn't provide JSP service.
	you have to add JSP dependency.
	let's add JSTL tag library dependency, too
	*add these lines  into application.properties
	spring.mvc.view.prefix=/WEB-INF/views/
	spring.mvc.view.suffix=.jsp
